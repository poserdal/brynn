      <h2>Pregnancy is hard</h2><br>
      <p class="lead">At The Mommy Box Company, we promise to be honest. Sure you'll look beautiful during your pregnancy, but you'll also be sick & swollen, and a lot of other things most people don't mention. Our boxes will contain all the details about what you can really expect from pregnancy.</p>

      <h2>We help you enjoy it.</h2><br>
      <p class="lead">We don't just inform. The boxes we send out are tailored for each month of pregnancy; along with tons of information, each box contains essentials (think nausea candies & skin cream), and some very needed pampering (think bath salts and candy). </p><br><br>
